Subject: [PATCH] Xi: do not keep linked list pointer during recursion

The `DisableDevice()` function is called whenever an enabled device
is disabled and it moves the device from the `inputInfo.devices` linked
list to the `inputInfo.off_devices` linked list.

However, its link/unlink operation has an issue during the recursive
call to `DisableDevice()` due to the `prev` pointer pointing to a
removed device.

This issue leads to a length mismatch between the total number of
devices and the number of device in the list, leading to a heap
overflow and, possibly, to local privilege escalation.

Simplify the code that checked whether the device passed to
`DisableDevice()` was in `inputInfo.devices` or not and find the
previous device after the recursion.

CVE-2024-21886, ZDI-CAN-22840
